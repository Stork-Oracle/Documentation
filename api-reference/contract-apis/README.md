# Contract APIs

This section contains an enumeration of the available smart-contract APIs that can developers can use in their applications on and off-chain. These functions are primarily useful for two functions:

* Writing Stork signed updates for specific assets to the contract - typically from off-chain applications
* Reading latest values for specific assets from the contract - typically from on-chain applications

The following APIs are available for supported chains:&#x20;

{% content-ref url="evm.md" %}
[evm.md](evm.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="solana.md" %}
[solana.md](solana.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="sui.md" %}
[sui.md](sui.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
