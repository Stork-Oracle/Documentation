## Using Stork in a Perpetual Exchange

#### Calculating Funding Rate

We recommend using the spot index price and your exchangeâ€™s contract price, to calculate the funding rate. If you elect to calculate the funding rate in discrete interval, we recommend using a time-weighted average.

#### Calculating Liquidations

We recommend using the mark price for liquidations, as it is meant to reflect the prevailing market price of the underlying contract.
