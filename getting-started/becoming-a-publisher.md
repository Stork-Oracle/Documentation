# Becoming a Publisher

Publishers on Stork are a decentralized network of data providers that are the origin of all data on Stork. For more information on publishers, see [How It Works](../introduction/how-it-works.md).

### Who Can Become a Publisher?

Anyone with high-frequency, high-accuracy, or first-party data can become a publisher on Stork. If you have data streams you feel would be useful on-chain or off-chain, don't hesitate to reach out about becoming a publisher.

### Setting up the Publisher Agent

The publisher agent is an open-source application that takes in your data and handles signing and communication with Stork Aggregators. It can be found in the[ stork-external github repo](https://github.com/Stork-Oracle/stork-external/blob/main/apps/publisher_agent/README.md), along with instructions for setting it up on your hardware via Docker.
