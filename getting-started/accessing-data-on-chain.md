# Accessing Data On-Chain

Stork's on-chain contracts are what ultimately allow leveraging Storks low-latency trustless data on-chain. This involves calling the chain-specific contracts version of a `get_temporal_numeric_value` function with the appropriate information about the relevant [Asset ID. ](../introduction/core-concepts.md#asset-ids)

To see which chains Stork currently supports, see the Contract Addresses section:

{% content-ref url="../resources/contract-addresses/" %}
[contract-addresses](../resources/contract-addresses/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

For specific documentation an interacting with the on-chain contracts interface, see the Contract APIs section:

{% content-ref url="../api-reference/contract-apis/" %}
[contract-apis](../api-reference/contract-apis/)
{% endcontent-ref %}
