# Stork Pushed Assets

Stork regularly pushes a set of price feeds on-chain across multiple chains. These feeds are accessible by [querying the Stork contract](../getting-started/accessing-data-on-chain.md). This page lists the available assets, along with their push triggers (maximum staleness and minimum price change percentage).

{% hint style="info" %}
Want access to a price feed on-chain that we're not pushing? See the [Putting Data On-Chain](../getting-started/putting-data-on-chain.md) to push it yourself, or reach out to Stork so we can get it pushed for you in as little as 24 hours. [sales@stork.network](mailto:sales@stork.network) or [Twitter DMs](https://x.com/storkoracle) open.
