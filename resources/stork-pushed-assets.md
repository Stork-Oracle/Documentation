# Stork Pushed Assets

A number of feeds on a number of chains are already made available (regularly pushed) on-chain by Stork. Accessing these feeds on chain is as simple as [plugging into the Stork contract](../getting-started/accessing-data-on-chain.md), and does not require pushing yourself. This page lists those assets, and the triggers to push them (maximum staleness, price change %).

{% hint style="info" %}
Want access to a price feed on-chain that we're not pushing? See the [Putting Data On-Chain](../getting-started/putting-data-on-chain.md) to push it yourself, or reach out to Stork so we can get it pushed for you in as little as 24 hours. [sales@stork.network](mailto:sales@stork.network) or [Twitter DMs](https://x.com/storkoracle) open.
