# Stork Fast

Stork Fast is a best-in-class oracle protocol enabling high-accuracy, high-frequency, low-latency financial data streams. Inheriting primitives and data aggregation techniques established by [Stork Core](../../introduction/core-concepts.md), Fast takes Stork’s battle-tested data feeds and ramps up performance by an order of magnitude, targeting millisecond level frequencies and latency.

A range of parameters, including frequency, as well as payload signature schemes, allow for fine-tuning Fast to suit the needs of any off or on-chain application out of the box, ensuring maximum performance for any specific use-case. Cryptographic verifiability allows for similar trustlessness guarantees as [Core](../../introduction/core-concepts.md#signatures).

Fast is also available as a bespoke oracle, and can be configured to provide specific data feeds with hand-tailored sources and aggregation parameters upon request. For a complete list of currently supported assets, please reach out.
